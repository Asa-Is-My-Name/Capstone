# OSU Spring 2023 Capstone

Collaborators: Asa Crimin, Kristin Eberman, Kayti Martens
Live Website: https://capstone-384605.wl.r.appspot.com/

This is the repo for all of the source code for our Oregon State University 2023 Capstone Project: Create a Web or Mobile Version Of a Climate Change Boardgame.
The goal of this project is to create a study tool that students in Sustainability 103 at Oregon State University can use to prepare for their midterms.

There are three main features to the site so far
Study: A practice quiz for the midterm
Play: A matching game that matches lecture slides to questions. There is also a review section to review which slides go with which questions.
Admin: Allows site administrators to add, edit, and delete questions from the question database

The Frontend is mainly html/CSS
The Backend is a Python3/Flask Framework.

The site is hosted on Google Cloud.
To recreate this project locally, you will have to create your own google cloud project and deploy these files to it. This will generate a new URL and a new database that will need questions added to it.

Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy the site!
